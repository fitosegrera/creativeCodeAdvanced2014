Image Processing
================

**Image processing experiment using python**

On the project you will find 3 .py files:

**main.py** --> is the mainn script, it is the one that has to be run. Basically this script calls and executes the function of the class **googleImg** that I wrote in a separate file, just to keep it clean.

**googleImg.py**--> Contains a class that uses the google API to search for a given word and return a JSON that then gets parsed to get only images. This file calls a second class I wrote called **generativeImg** that does the rest of the job.

**generativeImg.py** --> Contains a class with a function that loads all the images downloaded using the googleImg class and grabs 1000 pixels at random pisitions from each image. Then it generates a new image with the extracted pixels.

**folder fitosegrera** --> Contains all the downloaded images from the google image search. The folder is created dynamically and takes as a name the word that is being searched.

**test** is the new image generated by the program.
